Title: Quantum Classical Neural Networks Application

Description: This project analyzes and details the use cases of Quantum Neural Networks in comparison to Classical Neural Netorks. The report and project specifially try to determine if there is a distinct advantage within Quantum Computing models in the cases of ML(Machine Learning)  by testing pattern recognition and classification. The data set used is a publicly known data set called "Social Networks ads" which contains a 2D feature space: estimated salary and age.
