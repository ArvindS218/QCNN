Title: Quantum Classical Neural Networks in AI and ML

Description: This project analyzes and details the use cases of Quantum Classical Neural Networks in comparison to Classical Neural Netorks. This paper and project specifially try to determine if there is a distinct advantage within Quantum Computing models in the cases of ML(Machine Learning) and AI(Artificail Intelligence) by testing pattern recognition and classification.
